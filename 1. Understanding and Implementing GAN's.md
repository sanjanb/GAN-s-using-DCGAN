## Setting Up Google Colab

Google Colab is a free, cloud-based platform that allows you to run and execute Python code in an interactive environment. It provides access to GPUs and TPUs, which are essential for training deep learning models.

### Steps to Set Up Google Colab

1. **Navigate to Google Colab**: Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. **Sign In**: Use your Google account to sign in.
3. **Create a New Notebook**: Click on `File` > `New Notebook`.
4. **Rename the Notebook**: Give your notebook a meaningful name, such as `ConvolutionalFilters`.
5. **Select Runtime Type**:
   - Go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type`.
   - Select `Python 3` as the kernel.
   - Choose `CPU` for simple tasks or `GPU` for computationally intensive tasks.
6. **Access Folders**: Click on the folder icon to access folders in your runtime environment.
7. **Upload Data**: Right-click and select `Upload` to add data files, such as images, to your environment.

## Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models primarily used for computer vision tasks. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn hierarchical features from input images.

### Key Concepts

- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply learnable filters to input data to detect features like edges, textures, or patterns.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the input data by subsampling, focusing on the most important features.
- **Location Invariant Spatial Features**: CNNs can detect objects regardless of their location in the image.

### Architecture Overview

- **Convolutional Layer**: Applies filters to the input image to produce feature maps.
- **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: Produces the final output, such as image classification.

## Transforming a Multichannel Image to Tensor

Neural networks operate on images represented as tensors. Here's how to transform a multichannel image to a tensor format using PyTorch.

### Steps to Transform an Image

1. **Import Libraries**:
   ```python
   import torch
   import torch.nn as nn
   import torch.nn.functional as F
   import torchvision.transforms as T
   import numpy as np
   from PIL import Image
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```

2. **Read and Transform the Image**:
   ```python
   # Read the image
   image = Image.open('car.jpeg')

   # Define transformations
   transform = T.Compose([
       T.Resize((450, 800)),
       T.ToTensor()
   ])

   # Apply transformations
   img_tensor = transform(image)

   # Add batch size dimension
   img_tensor = img_tensor.unsqueeze(0)
   ```

3. **Verify the Tensor Shape**:
   ```python
   print(img_tensor.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([1, 3, 450, 800])
   ```

## Applying Convolutional and Pooling Layers

Apply convolutional kernels and pooling layers to an input image to extract feature maps and reduce dimensionality.

### Steps to Apply Layers

1. **Define a Convolutional Kernel**:
   ```python
   sharpen_filter = torch.Tensor([[[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 9, -1], [-1, -1, -1]]])
   ```

2. **Apply the Convolutional Kernel**:
   ```python
   conv_output = F.conv2d(img_tensor, sharpen_filter, padding=0)
   ```

3. **Apply Pooling Layer**:
   ```python
   pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
   pool_output = pool(conv_output)
   ```

4. **Visualize the Results**:
   ```python
   # Convert to NumPy and plot
   conv_image = conv_output[0, 0].detach().numpy()
   pool_image = pool_output[0, 0].detach().numpy()

   plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
   plt.imshow(conv_image, cmap='viridis')
   plt.title('Convolutional Layer Output')

   plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
   plt.imshow(pool_image, cmap='viridis')
   plt.title('Pooling Layer Output')

   plt.show()
   ```

## Viewing the Effect of Different Filters

Explore different convolutional kernels to understand their effects on the input image.

### Examples of Filters

1. **Vertical Edge Detection**:
   ```python
   vertical_edge_kernel = torch.Tensor([[[-1, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 1]]])
   ```

2. **Horizontal Edge Detection**:
   ```python
   horizontal_edge_kernel = torch.Tensor([[[-1, -1, -1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]])
   ```

3. **Sobel Filter for Vertical Edges**:
   ```python
   sobel_vertical_kernel = torch.Tensor([[[-1, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]])
   ```

4. **Gaussian Blur Filter**:
   ```python
   gaussian_blur_kernel = torch.Tensor([[[1/16, 2/16, 1/16], [2/16, 4/16, 2/16], [1/16, 2/16, 1/16]]])
   ```

5. **Emboss Filter**:
   ```python
   emboss_kernel = torch.Tensor([[[-2, -1, 0], [-1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 2]]])
   ```

### Visualize the Effects

Apply each filter using the `apply_kernel_and_show` function and observe the differences in the output feature maps.
